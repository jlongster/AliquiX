A modern, high-performance 3d graphics engine that competes with Unity and Unreal.

Naw, just kidding. This is a simple 3d engine I wrote back in 2006 when I was in college. Although it's missing a ton of stuff, it's actually quite straight-forward! Makes we want to hack on native 3d games again.

Don't expect documentation, I just wanted to through this up on github.
